# Documentation File Policy

**IMPORTANT**: This project maintains a single documentation file. Do NOT create additional documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Rules

1. **Never proactively create** documentation files such as:
   - README.md
   - CONTRIBUTING.md
   - CHANGELOG.md
   - API.md
   - GUIDE.md
   - Any other .md files for documentation purposes

2. **Only create documentation files when**:
   - The user explicitly asks: "Create a README" or "Add a CONTRIBUTING.md"
   - The user specifically requests documentation to be written

3. **Default behavior**:
   - Assume documentation already exists or isn't needed
   - Focus on code implementation, not documentation
   - If you think documentation would help, suggest it but don't create it

## Examples

```python
# ❌ BAD - Don't do this automatically
# After implementing a feature:
# "I've also created a README.md to document the API..."

# ✅ GOOD - Only suggest if relevant
# "The implementation is complete. Would you like me to create 
# documentation for the new API endpoints?"
```
