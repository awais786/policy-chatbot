# Test Runner Subagent Usage

**CRITICAL**: Always delegate test execution to the `test-runner` subagent.

## When to Use the Test Runner Subagent

Use the test-runner subagent for ANY test-related task:

- Running unit tests
- Running integration tests
- Running Django test suite
- Executing pytest
- Generating coverage reports
- Analyzing test failures
- Summarizing test results

## How to Use

Instead of running test commands directly, delegate to the subagent:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Delegate to test-runner subagent
Use the test-runner subagent to run all Django tests and summarize results

# ❌ BAD - Don't run tests directly
python manage.py test
```

## Examples

```python
# Running all tests
"Use the test-runner subagent to run all tests"

# Running specific app tests
"Use the test-runner subagent to run tests for the cart app"

# Running with coverage
"Use the test-runner subagent to run pytest with coverage and report missing tests"

# Analyzing failures
"Use the test-runner subagent to run failing tests and provide structured output"
```

## Benefits

- Structured JSON output for easy parsing
- Consistent test reporting format
- Automatic failure analysis
- Actionable recommendations
- Machine-readable results

## Exception

Only run tests directly if the user explicitly requests a specific command to be executed verbatim.
